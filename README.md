Dataset Overview

The Netflix dataset used in this project is a cleaned and combined version of multiple data sources.
It represents user-item interactions in the form of a user-rating matrix. The rows correspond to users, the columns correspond to movies, and the cell values indicate the user's rating for a given movie. Missing values represent movies that users have not rated.
